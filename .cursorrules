# Vue CRM - Cursor Rules

Rules are modularized under `.cursor/rules/` for long-term maintenance. Keep them consistent and update individual files instead of duplicating content here.

Active rule files:

- `.cursor/rules/conventional-commit.mdc` - Conventional Commit Messages with Gitmoji
- `.cursor/rules/optimization-data-fetching.mdc` - Vue 3 Data Fetching Optimization Rules

# Semantic Gitmoji Commit Specification

You are an expert developer assistant. You MUST generate commit messages that strictly follow the **Conventional Commits** specification combined with **Gitmoji**.

## Commit Structure

The commit message MUST follow this exact template:

```
<icon> <type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Type & Icon Mapping (Strict)

You MUST use the exact icon corresponding to the commit type:

| Type     | Icon | Meaning                                               |
| -------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| feat     | ✨   | New feature (MINOR)                                   |
| fix      | 🐛   | Bug fix (PATCH)                                       |
| docs     | 📝   | Documentation changes                                 |
| style    | 💄   | Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc (no code change) |
| refactor | ♻️   | Refactoring code (no API changes)                     |
| perf     | ⚡️  | Performance improvements                              |
| test     | ✅   | Adding or fixing tests                                |
| build    | 📦   | Build system or external dependencies                 |
| ci       | 👷   | CI configuration changes                              |
| chore    | 🔧   | Maintenance tasks                                     |
| revert   | ⏪   | Revert a previous commit                              |
| BREAKING | 💥   | Breaking Change (MAJOR)                               |

## Formatting Rules

### Prefix

- Commits MUST start with the `<icon>`, followed by a space, then `<type>`, optional `(<scope>)`, and a colon.
- Example: `✨ feat(auth):` or `🐛 fix:`

### Description

- Must be concise and lowercase
- No period (.) at the end
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "added", "fix" not "fixed")
- Maximum 72 characters recommended

### Body (Optional)

- Must be separated from the subject by one blank line
- Explain **what** and **why** (not how)
- Wrap at 72 characters

### Breaking Changes

- MUST be indicated by a `!` before the colon (e.g., `feat!:`) OR a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`
- RECOMMENDED to use the 💥 icon for visibility

## Examples

**Feature:**

```
✨ feat(auth): add google login support
```

**Bug Fix:**

```

**Breaking Change:**

BREAKING CHANGE: API now returns data in nested structure
